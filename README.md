## `getRecordCount`

***Goal :***
  * return number of rows
  
***How to call:***
```php
  $this->BasicModels->getRecordCount('tbl_name',$condition_array);
```
***Parameters :***
> ++ indicates parameter is must

- `$tbl_name++ `: name of table 
- `$condition `: array('column_name1'=>$column_val1,'column_name2'=>$column_val2);


## `getRecords`

***Goal :***
  * return array of records from table (without softDelete)
  
***How to call:***
```php
  $this->BasicModels->getRecords('tbl_name',$condition_array,$select,...);
```
***Parameters :***
> ++ indicates parameter is must

- `$tbl_name++ `: name of table 
- `$condition `: array('column_name1'=>$column_val1,'column_name2'=>$column_val2);
- `$select `: ('col1,col2,col3');
- `$order_by `: array('colname1'=>order,'colname2'=>order); Order='ASC OR DESC';
- `$start `: start for paging (number);
- `$limit `: limit for paging (number);
- `$join `: array('jointable'=>$table_b,'match_a'=>$table_a_reference,'match_b'=>$table_b_reference,'join_type'=>$join_type); join_type = FALSE/'LEFT'/'RIGHT';

> In case where we need joins, you can pass joins in controller also:
> Ex: $this->db->join('tbl_nameB AS b','tbl_nameA.col=b.col','left');
>     $this->BasicModels->getRecords('tbl_name',$condition_array,$select,...);
